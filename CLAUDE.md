# CLAUDE.md - ASCIIGen Project Documentation

This file provides context and guidance for AI assistants working on the ASCIIGen project.

## Project Overview

ASCIIGen is a Rust application that generates ASCII art from images using genetic algorithms with parallel processing support. The project was built incrementally with comprehensive testing and modern Rust best practices.

## Architecture

### Core Modules

1. **`src/main.rs`** - CLI interface and application entry point
   - Uses `clap` for command-line argument parsing
   - Coordinates all modules to run the genetic algorithm
   - Handles user input validation and output

2. **`src/image_processor.rs`** - Image loading and processing
   - Loads images using the `image` crate
   - Resizes images with high-quality Lanczos3 filtering via `fast_image_resize`
   - Converts images to grayscale for fitness comparison
   - All methods include comprehensive documentation and error handling

3. **`src/ascii_generator.rs`** - ASCII art generation and font rendering
   - Renders ASCII characters using TrueType fonts via `rusttype`
   - Caches all 7-bit ASCII characters (0x20-0x7F) for performance
   - Generates ASCII art images from character arrays
   - Uses DejaVu Sans Mono font (included in `assets/` directory)

4. **`src/genetic_algorithm.rs`** - Genetic algorithm implementation
   - Population-based evolution with configurable population size (default 80)
   - Tournament selection, uniform crossover, and mutation operations
   - Parallel fitness evaluation using `rayon`
   - Elite preservation (top 10% survive each generation)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Parallel Processing**: Uses `rayon` for multi-threaded fitness evaluation
   - Significant performance improvements (37-41% faster with 4-8 threads)
   - Thread pool configured based on user input (`-j/--jobs` option)
   - Larger populations (200-800) more effectively utilize high core count systems

2. **Font Rendering**: Uses embedded TrueType font for consistent character rendering
   - Font file must be placed in `assets/DejaVuSansMono.ttf`
   - Characters are pre-rendered and cached for performance

3. **Smart Fitness Function**: Non-background pixel focused evaluation
   - Pre-calculates non-background pixel count from target image
   - Only evaluates meaningful pixels (foreground content)
   - Penalizes false positives (ASCII characters where target is background)
   - Tolerance of 30/255 for pixel intensity differences
   - Returns realistic fitness scores that reflect actual image similarity

4. **Intelligent Initialization**: Background probability-based population creation
   - Calculates percentage of background pixels in target image
   - Uses this probability to place spaces vs characters during initialization
   - Creates realistic starting populations that match target image structure

5. **Background-Aware Mutation**: Maintains realistic character distribution
   - Uses same background probability as initialization during mutation
   - Preserves sparse character placement throughout evolution

6. **Initialization Options**: Support for both random and character-based initialization
   - Random: Uses background probability for realistic distribution
   - Character-based: 95% specified character + 5% random for diversity

7. **Time-Based Progress**: Configurable status update intervals
   - Default 1.0 second intervals with elapsed time tracking
   - Replaces fixed generation-based updates for consistent user feedback

8. **Debug Mode**: Optional debug image output for analysis
   - Saves converted input image as PNG (resized grayscale version)
   - Saves final ASCII art as rendered PNG image (same size as fitness comparison buffer)
   - Files named `debug_input_<filename>.png` and `debug_ascii_<filename>.png`
   - Both images are identical dimensions for pixel-perfect comparison
   - Supports both black and white background modes

9. **Verbose Mode**: Real-time evolution progress display
   - Shows current best ASCII art at each status update interval
   - Helps monitor genetic algorithm convergence
   - Useful for tuning parameters and understanding evolution progress

10. **Limited Character Set**: Optimized character palette for ASCII art
    - Uses curated set: ` <>,./?\\|[]{}-_=+AvViIoOxXwWM`~;:'"!@#$%^&*()8`
    - Provides good visual variety while maintaining readability
    - Avoids problematic characters that don't render well

11. **Background Color Options**: Flexible output formatting
   - Default: White characters on black background (terminal-friendly)
   - White background mode: Black characters on white background (print-friendly)
   - Proper color inversion for cached character images

## Command Line Interface

```bash
Usage: asciigen [OPTIONS] <INPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>  Input image file path

Options:
  -w, --width <WIDTH>              Width in characters
  -H, --height <HEIGHT>            Height in characters

  -h, --help                       Print help
```

### Interactive ncurses UI

By default, ASCIIGen uses an interactive ncurses-based text user interface that provides:

- **Real-time Progress Display**: Shows current generation, progress percentage, and estimated time to completion
- **Fitness Tracking**: Displays current best fitness with color-coded indicators (red < 30%, yellow 30-70%, green > 70%)
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time generations per second calculation, elapsed time, and active thread count
- **Thread Information**: Displays number of threads used for parallel fitness calculation
- **ASCII Dimensions**: Shows target ASCII art size in characters (width Ã— height)
- **Interactive Control**: Press 'q' to quit early, other keys for future controls
- **Live ASCII Preview**: When verbose mode is enabled, shows the current best ASCII art in real-time
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Graphical representation of evolution progress with filled/empty indicators
- **Color-Coded Interface**: Uses terminal colors to highlight important information
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to console output if ncurses initialization fails

The ncurses UI provides a much more engaging and informative experience compared to simple console output.

Use `--no-ui` to disable the interactive interface and use traditional console output instead.

### Validation Rules
- Must specify either width OR height (not both)
- Population size must be between 20 and 1000
- Initialization character must be from the allowed character set
- Thread count should be reasonable (1-16 typically)
- Status interval can be fractional seconds (e.g., 0.5, 2.5)
- For optimal performance, match population size to available CPU cores
- Debug and verbose modes can be used together for comprehensive analysis

### Performance Tests
- Multi-threading performance improvements
- Fitness calculation timing
- Memory usage with different population sizes

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New CLI Options
1. Add field to `Args` struct in `main.rs`
2. Update `GeneticAlgorithm::evolve()` or other method signatures if needed
3. Pass value through the call chain to relevant functions
4. Update tests that create `GeneticAlgorithm` instances or call affected methods
5. Update help documentation and CLAUDE.md

### Modifying Character Set
- Update `ALLOWED_CHARS` constant in `genetic_algorithm.rs`
- Ensure character cache in `AsciiGenerator` covers all allowed characters
- Update tests to use characters from the new set
- Consider fitness implications of character changes

### Modifying Genetic Algorithm Parameters
- Population size: Configurable via CLI (20-1000), default 80
- Elite size: 10% of population, calculated in `GeneticAlgorithm::new()`
- Mutation rate: 1%, in `GeneticAlgorithm::new()`
- Crossover rate: 80%, in `GeneticAlgorithm::new()`
- Tournament size: 3, in `tournament_selection()`

### Population Size Recommendations
- **1-4 cores**: 40-80 population
- **6-8 cores**: 80-150 population
- **12+ cores**: 200-400 population
- **24+ cores**: 400-800 population

Larger populations provide better genetic diversity but require more CPU cores for efficient parallel processing.

### Adding New Fitness Functions
1. Create new method in `GeneticAlgorithm`
2. Update `calculate_fitness_for_chars_static()` for parallel support
3. Consider creating a trait for different fitness strategies
4. Add comprehensive tests

## Performance Characteristics

### Typical Performance (20x10 characters, 10 generations)
- 1 thread: ~1.1 seconds
- 4 threads: ~0.7 seconds (37% improvement)
- 8 threads: ~0.66 seconds (41% improvement)

### Memory Usage
- Font caching: ~95 character images in memory
- Population: 40 individuals Ã— character array size
- Target image: Full resolution + resized grayscale copy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Font Loading Failures**
   - Ensure `assets/DejaVuSansMono.ttf` exists and is a valid TTF file
   - Check file permissions
   - Font is embedded at compile time via `include_bytes!`

2. **Compilation Errors with Rayon**
   - Ensure thread pool is initialized before use
   - Use `Arc` for thread-safe sharing of references
   - Be careful with borrowing in parallel contexts

3. **Poor Fitness Convergence**
   - Try different initialization characters
   - Increase population size or generations
   - Check image preprocessing (size, contrast)

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Profile fitness calculation bottlenecks
   - Consider image size vs. character count ratio
   - Monitor thread utilization

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**
   ```rust
   println!("Generation {}: Best fitness = {:.2}%", generation, best_fitness * 100.0);
   ```

2. **Visualize Population Diversity**
   - Print character histograms
   - Track fitness distribution across population

3. **Profile Performance**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   time ./target/release/asciigen image.jpg --width 20
   ```
